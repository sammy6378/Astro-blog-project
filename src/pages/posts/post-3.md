# Adding Dynamic Content with Astro

Published on: 2022-07-15

Astro isn't just for static sites! In this post, I learned how to fetch data from APIs and display it dynamically.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Fetching Data**: I set up my first API call to fetch data and display it on a page dynamically.
   
2. **Rendering Dynamic Pages**: I learned how to create dynamic routes in Astro, so pages are generated based on the data I fetch.

3. **Handling State**: While Astro focuses on static content, I explored how to handle small amounts of client-side interactivity using JavaScript.

## What's next

I plan to explore more APIs and integrate them into my site for richer content.
