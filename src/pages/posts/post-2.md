# Learning Components in Astro

Published on: 2022-07-08

In this post, I dive into the world of components in Astro. It has been exciting to learn how to build reusable UI pieces!

## What I've learned

1. **Component Basics**: I created my first component and learned how to pass data to it via props.
   
2. **Reusing Components**: I discovered how Astro makes it easy to reuse components across pages, keeping my code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

3. **Integrating with JavaScript Frameworks**: I also started experimenting with integrating React components into my Astro project.

## What's next

I plan to build more complex components and explore how to manage state within Astro components.
